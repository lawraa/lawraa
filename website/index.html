                    <h2 align="left"><b>Lawrance 陳守仁</b></h2>
                    <p>Lawrance Chen (陳守仁) received a high school diploma from <a href="https://www.tcis.ac.th/">Thai-Chinese International School</a>, Thailand. I am currently studying my second year of <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/">Electrical Engineering</a>                        in <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/index.html">NTU</a>. </p>
                    <p>I ended my high school academics with a 4.02 out of 4 GPA. In my junior year, I received a partial scholarship from TCIS, which was only given to three students from each grade level. I was recognized by the National Honor Society
                        (NHS) of TCIS and was invited to join. The four pillars of NHS are leadership, service, scholarship, and character; I was involved in every single category. I have served in elected leadership for the class of 2020’s executive
                        committee for four straight years, organizing class events, fundraising over 500,000 baht for the class of 2019’s prom, and organizing multiple food sales. I also have been ONE club (an environmental club) member for three years,
                        and the vice president this year. Furthermore, I joined the student council in the last three years of high school, being the leader of the Information Technology department for two years, and holding all the big events in the
                        entire school. I also participated in many community service events, collecting an astounding amount of over 100 hours of community service. </p>
